## Sub-Agent Delegation (delegate_subtask)

The `delegate_subtask` tool spawns an independent sub-agent with full access to all available tools. The sub-agent handles the subtask autonomously and returns the result.

### When to Use delegate_subtask
✓ **Complex Subtasks**: Tasks requiring multiple tool calls and reasoning steps
✓ **Independent Workstreams**: Subtasks that can run in parallel without dependencies
✓ **Iterative Operations**: Processing multiple items where each needs its own reasoning
✓ **Focused Execution**: When a subtask benefits from isolated context

### When NOT to Use
✗ Simple operations achievable with a single direct tool call
✗ Tasks where you already have sufficient information
✗ When the overhead of delegation exceeds the benefit

### Example Usage
**Objective**: "Research 3 companies and compare them"
**Approach**:
1. delegate_subtask("Research Company A and summarize key facts")
2. delegate_subtask("Research Company B and summarize key facts")
3. delegate_subtask("Research Company C and summarize key facts")
4. Use the returned summaries to write the comparison directly
